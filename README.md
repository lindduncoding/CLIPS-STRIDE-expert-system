# STRIDE-expert-system
An attempt to make an expert system in the realm of cybersecurity ;)

STRIDE is an acronym of Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege. It is a widely used cybersecurity framework to identify threats and mitigate them. The main idea of this expert system is that the user will be asked a bunch of yes-no questions about an attack that has happened in their organization. And then the system will identify which STRIDE category does the attack fall to. It then can give the user mitigation steps!

## Improvement
The stride-1.clp file is a new and improved version with certainty factor. Go give it a try!

## WARNING
THIS IS NOT A COMPREHENSIVE LIST! 
I don't recommend using a college student's assignment to detect anomaly in your system. (Also expert systems can't learn I think it's better for you to build a Machine Learning model to detect anomalies instead)
